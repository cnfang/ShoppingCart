This project is to remind me of differnt ways to perform unit test on spring boot application.

## ToDo
`Customer*.java` basically shows how to perform unit test over standard functions provided by JUnit & Mockito.
`Product*.java` on the other hands shows how to activate spring-boot environment (bean autowiring) for unit test.
